## Using Dynamic Workflow

Dynamic Workflows allows you to expose your internal workflow to external users. This allows you to leverage your existing workflows and allows you to create workflows that are more dynamic.

![Step 1](./image1.png)

You can disable options such as reminders or deadlines to prevent users from changing the workflow.

![Step 2](./image2.png)

You can also disable the dropdown allowing it to be a static workflow only

![Step 3](./image3.png)

Your workflows can contain prefilled data, so that your user will not need to fill out the data.
