<h2>Using Dynamic Workflow</h2>
<p>Dynamic Workflows allows you to expose your internal workflow to external users. This allows you to leverage your existing workflows and allows you to create workflows that are more dynamic.</p>

<p>You can disable options such as reminders or deadlines to prevent users from changing the workflow.</p>
